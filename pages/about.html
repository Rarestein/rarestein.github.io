            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Rareș, and I am a student and web developer based in Sibiu, Romania. I am passionate about
                web
                development and I love learning new things.</p>

            <h2>Give us a bit of context. How did you get here?</h2>
            <p>
                It all started in 2005, when I got my first computer. While back then I only played games and surfed the
                web, I wanted to know how all of these programs were made.
                <br>
                Years later, in middle school, I've started attending
                Palatul Copiilor in Buzău, where I've learned basic programming concepts and how to code using Borland
                Pascal.
                <br>
                I've studied Mathematics and Computer Science in Buzău, at the Alexandru Marghiloman high school. There,
                I've
                had the chance to attend the Information Technology and Communications Olympiad. While I didn't expect
                much,
                my
                knowledge in using various Windows features and the Office suite landed me in the National stage. For
                this
                stage, I've learned how to create websites and I've imediatelly fell in love with it. Finally, at the
                National
                stage I got the bronze medal.
                <br>
                In 2020, I've started studying Information Technology at the Lucian Blaga University in Sibiu. Two years
                later,
                I've started working as a Software Intern at Continental Automotive Systems. There, I've had the chance
                to learn JavaScript, and to develope internal tools, scripts and dashboards using Node-RED.
            </p>

            <h2>Tell us about your skills</h2>
            <p>
                I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. I am also good at React, SQL, Node-RED and MATLAB.
            </p>

            <h2>Any hobbies outside coding?</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy activities such as driving, dancing and playing video games and sports.
                <br>
                I am also passionate of music and the process of creating it.
